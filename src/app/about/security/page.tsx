              At Terapai, we take the security of your data very seriously.
              This page outlines the measures we implement to protect your information

            <p>
              <strong>Encryption in Transit:</strong> All data transmitted between your
              device and our servers is encrypted using HTTPS/TLS (Transport Layer
              Security). This ensures that your data is protected from eavesdropping
              or tampering during transmission.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Encryption at Rest:</strong> We encrypt sensitive data stored on
              our servers using industry-standard encryption algorithms (e.g., AES-256).
              This protects your data even if physical access to the storage media
              were compromised.
