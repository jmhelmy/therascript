        In psychotherapy and counseling, SOAP notes are an essential tool for documenting client sessions, tracking progress, formulating treatment plans, and ensuring continuity of care. They provide a structured way to record subjective experiences, objective observations, clinical assessments, and plans for future interventions, all while maintaining client confidentiality and adhering to professional ethical standards.

      <p className={styles.paragraph}>
        Effective SOAP notes in a therapeutic context help therapists organize their thoughts, reflect on session dynamics, and make informed clinical decisions. They are also vital for insurance billing, supervision, and legal documentation.

        <ul className={styles.list}>
          <li className={styles.listItem}>
            <strong>Subjective (S):</strong> This section captures the client's perspective on their experiences, feelings, and progress since the last session. It includes their stated reason for the visit, reported symptoms (e.g., mood, anxiety levels, sleep patterns, stressors), life events, coping mechanisms, and their perception of the therapeutic process. Direct client quotes can be very powerful here.
          </li>
          <li className={styles.listItem}>
            <strong>Objective (O):</strong> This section includes the therapist's objective observations of the client during the session. This can encompass:
            <ul style={{ listStyleType: 'circle', marginLeft: '20px', marginTop: '0.5rem' }}>
              <li>Appearance and behavior (e.g., grooming, eye contact, motor activity).</li>
              <li>Affect and mood (e.g., congruent, labile, restricted).</li>
              <li>Speech (e.g., rate, volume, coherence).</li>
              <li>Thought process and content (e.g., logical, tangential, presence of delusions or suicidal/homicidal ideation â€“ assess risk immediately if present).</li>
              <li>Interpersonal interactions and rapport with the therapist.</li>
              <li>Results of any standardized measures or screening tools administered (e.g., PHQ-9, GAD-7 scores).</li>
              <li>Client's engagement in therapeutic activities or techniques.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li className={styles.listItem}>
            <strong>Assessment (A):</strong> The therapist's clinical analysis and interpretation of the subjective and objective information. This includes:
            <ul style={{ listStyleType: 'circle', marginLeft: '20px', marginTop: '0.5rem' }}>
              <li>A summary of the client's current clinical status and functioning.</li>
